# Archived Planning Documents

**Archive Date**: 2025-01-14
**Status**: Superseded by V2-ENHANCEMENT-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md

---

## Why These Documents Were Archived

The following documents have been **consolidated into a single master implementation plan**:

1. **ELECTRON-APP-V2-COMPREHENSIVE-PLAN.md** (v2.1)
2. **PIPELINE-INTEGRATION-PLAN.md** (v1.0)

### Reason for Consolidation

These two documents contained overlapping information and were developed separately. During implementation planning, the following issues were identified:

- **Duplicate Content**: Both documents described the pipeline integration
- **Inconsistent Phasing**: Original plans had 9 phases (PIPELINE) + 2 phases (COMPREHENSIVE), unclear how they related
- **Missing Information**: No git workflow strategy, testing approach, or database schema analysis
- **Unclear Dependencies**: Which features depended on which phases?

### What Changed in the Consolidated Plan

The new consolidated plan (**V2-ENHANCEMENT-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md**) includes:

✅ **Database Schema Analysis**
- Identified that ZERO schema changes are required for phases 1-13
- Existing `liquidity_allocation_config` and `allocation_status_thresholds` tables are perfect for Strategic Allocation
- Optional `report_history` table can be skipped initially

✅ **Bite-Sized Phases** (15 instead of 11)
- 2-4 days each for easier testing and rollback
- Clear dependencies between phases
- Grouped into 5 major milestones

✅ **Git Workflow Strategy**
- Clone-based development approach (cash-management-v3)
- 5 merge points to master for stable checkpoints
- Feature branches per phase
- Git tags for rollback points

✅ **Testing Strategy**
- Testing checklist template per phase
- Regression testing requirements
- Performance testing guidelines

✅ **Development Strategy**
- Why clone instead of branch-only
- Shared database safety (zero schema changes)
- Cut-over strategy when complete

## Consolidated Document Location

**New Master Plan**: `/docs/electron-app/V2-ENHANCEMENT-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`

This single document contains all information from both archived documents, plus additional implementation details discovered during planning.

## Version History Mapping

| Old Document | Version | New Document Section |
|--------------|---------|---------------------|
| PIPELINE-INTEGRATION-PLAN.md | v1.0 | Phases 1-9, IPC Handlers, Component Architecture |
| ELECTRON-APP-V2-COMPREHENSIVE-PLAN.md | v2.1 | Phases 10-15, Strategic Allocation, Native Reporting |
| (New Content) | - | Database Schema Analysis, Git Workflow, Testing Strategy |

## If You Need to Reference Old Documents

These archived documents are kept for historical reference only. **Do not use them for implementation** - they contain outdated information and conflicting phase numbering.

For implementation, always refer to: **V2-ENHANCEMENT-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md (v3.0)**

---

## Timeline Evolution

- **v1.0** (PIPELINE): 9 phases, 20-28 days
- **v2.0** (COMPREHENSIVE): Added 2 phases, 27-39 days total
- **v3.0** (CONSOLIDATED): 15 phases, 44 days (~9 weeks)

The increase from 20-28 days to 44 days reflects:
- More realistic phase breakdown (smaller, testable chunks)
- Added testing time per phase
- More thorough planning and documentation

**Status**: These documents are archived for historical reference only.
**Action**: Use V2-ENHANCEMENT-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md for all implementation work.
